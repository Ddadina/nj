                <h3>STYLE OF MUSIC</h3>
                <p> Newjeans have a unique style that harkens back to early 2000s, when pop culture was represented by vintage stickers, cassette tapes and CDs. It was this carefully thought-out concept that brought some fresh to K-pop. Elements of Y2K's style can be seen in almost all of their MV's/ and songs. Without a doubt, NewJeans started a new wave and exemplified that style.</p>
